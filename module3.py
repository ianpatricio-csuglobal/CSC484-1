Title: Daily Hydration Logger with Statistics
Author: Ian Patricio
Description:
    This program tracks the user's daily water intake in glasses and logs it with a timestamp.
    It calculates the total, average intake, and how close the user is to the daily goal.
    The program demonstrates exception handling using try, except, and finally blocks.
    Promotes health awareness through hydration encouragement and daily logging.
